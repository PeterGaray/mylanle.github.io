                    <p class="aboutme2">Hello! My name is Mylan [mee-lan]. I graduated in 2017 at Virginia Polytechnic
                        State and
                        University with a BFA in Studio Arts and Design. Currently I am attending UC Berkeley Extension
                        to
                        receive my certificate in UX/UI Design. Currently I am a full-time graphic designer in the San
                        Francisco
                        Bay Area but hope to transition careers into the User Interface field. Outside of that, I am a
                        hardcore
                        TV binge-watcher, video gamer, and bubbly illustrator. Something special about me is that I
                        can’t stick
                        to one style of art. I love graphic design, but I also love telling stories through
                        illustrating. I get
                        inspired by too many things and I love trying them all out. Art has pretty much stuck with me
                        since I
                        was born (drew a lot of manga as a kid), and I would like to explore as much as possible to be a
                        better
                        artist for myself.</p>
