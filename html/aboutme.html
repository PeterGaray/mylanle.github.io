            <p class="aboutme2">Hello! My name is Mylan [mee-lan]. I graduated in 2017 at Virginia Polytechnic State and University with a BFA in Studio Arts and Design. Currently I am attending UC Berkeley Extension to receive my certificate in UX/UI Design. Currently I am a full-time graphic designer in the San Francisco Bay Area but hope to transition careers into the User Interface field. Outside of that, I am a hardcore TV binge-watcher, video gamer, and bubbly illustrator. Something special about me is that I can’t stick to one style of art. I love graphic design, but I also love telling stories through illustrating. I get inspired by too many things and I love trying them all out. Art has pretty much stuck with me since I was born (drew a lot of manga as a kid), and I would like to explore as much as possible to be a better artist for myself.</p>
